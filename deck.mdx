## AcciCheck

A web based project to detect accidents on road and inform the nearest hospital.

---

Our model is trained using openCV.
It detects collision of two objects, either 2 vehicles or vehicle
with a person.

---

Upon detection of an accident, a notification (here an email)
is sent to the nearest hospital


---

The nearest hospital to every CCTV camera is 
stored in our MongoDB Database.


---

Finally all the statistics for every location, season, time of the day are collected and
shown in a centralized database.
The model is trained and predicts the probability of accident.

Thank You
